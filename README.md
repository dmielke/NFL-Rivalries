# Graphing NFL Rivalries

## Project Objective
The NFL includes some of the longest-running and prominent rivalries in American sports. Unfortunately, fans have fairly limited, and often subjective, insight into how these rivalries have progressed over time. This project provides insight into NFL rivalries by graphing the win-loss balance between two teams in a rivalry.

## R Script
The Graphing NFL Rivalries Over Time.R file contains the ggplot2 code for reproducing the Packers vs Bears rivalry graph, which is shown below.

The graph illustrates the win-loss difference (line graph) between the Packers and the Bears since the beginning of their rivalry in November 1921. Additionally, the graph includes the margin of victory for each game (bar graph).

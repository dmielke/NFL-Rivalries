# Graphing NFL Rivalries

## Project Objective
The NFL includes some of the longest-running and most well known rivalries in American sporting history. Unfortunately, fans have fairly limited, and often subjective, insight into how these rivalries have progressed over time. This project provides insight into NFL rivalries by graphing the win-loss balance between two teams in a rivalry.
